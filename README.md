# VBA-Challenge
# stock-analysis project (Module 2 Challenge submitted to UPENN Data Science Bootcamp)

This Module 2 Challenge aims to analyze stock data in Microsoft Excel using VBA script. 

I collaborated with my colleagues in the study group, namely Victoria Martin-Nelson, Mike Pointek, Patrick Dean, Katie Ballinger, Jordan Underwood, Kyle Tener, and Sarah Schilling, to develop a VBA script.

Victoria, who leads the study group, helped us with the algorithm and processes. She mentioned that she received support from her friend and referred to two GitHub repositories. The links to these repositories are as follows: https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/stock-analysis.git https://github.com/cmac18/Analysis-of-Stock-Market-Data.git.

Apart from Victoria's guidance, I also used certain parts of codes from these repositories to develop mine. Finally, I sought assistance from ChatGPT to organize and refine the code, making it more descriptive and easier to understand.
